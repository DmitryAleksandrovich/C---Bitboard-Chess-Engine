# C---Bitboard-Chess-Engine
This is a work-in-progress C++ Bitboard Chess Engine

PLEASE FEEL FREE TO LEAVE ANY COMMENTS OR SUGGESTIONS!

This is an extremely simple chess engine that as of right now compiles fine with the latest version of Orwell Dev-C++
To compile, just start a new project and add all the .cpp files to it. Do not add the "magicmoves.c" to the project. This will compile perfectly. I will come out with a Makefile very soon for those without an IDE. If you do not know how to compile, I have compiled an .exe. Just go to the release section of this repository. I only do a release when I get a major amount of progress done, so you may have to wait a while for the next release!
The whole goal of my program is clarity and simplicity. I want to teach beginners at chess programming and at chess how to do both. We were all beginner programmers once. I struggled with the concept of bitboards for a long time and this is my contribution to those who don't understand them.
Feel absolutely free to make a pull request and make a comment. That's what programming is all about!

Thank you!
