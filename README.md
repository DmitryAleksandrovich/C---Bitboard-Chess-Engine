# C---Bitboard-Chess-Engine
This is a work-in-progress C++ Bitboard Chess Engine

This is an extremely simple chess engine that as of right now compiles fine with MinGW 4.9.2

I struggled with the concept of bitboards for a long time and this is my contribution to those who cannot understand them. 
Thank you.
