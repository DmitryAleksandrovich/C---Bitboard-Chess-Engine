# C---Bitboard-Chess-Engine
This is a work-in-progress C++ Bitboard Chess Engine

This is an extremely simple chess engine that as of right now compiles fine with MinGW 4.9.2
To compile, simply navigate  to the directory you keep this code in from the command prompt, and type make. This will compile perfectly. Yes, the makefile is rudimentary, but  it keeps things simple. If you do not know how to compile, I have compiled an .exe. Just go to the release section of this repository. 
The whole goal of my program is clarity and simplicity. I want to teach beginners at chess programming and at chess how to do both. We were all beginner programmers once. I struggled with the concept of bitboards for a long time and this is my contribution to those who don't understand them.
Feel absolutely free to make a pull request and make a comment. That's what programming is all about!

Thank you!
